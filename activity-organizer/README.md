# Activity Organizer 
Purpose of activity organizer is to bring people together by organizing the their activities efficiently and intelligently.

## Why?
The idea is to make it simple for people to organize their activities, and invite other people to share the activities with them.

## Main features
- Users can create activities
- Users can invite other people to join their activities, by sending them an "activity request" stating what's going to happen and when
- Users can accept the offers, decline or re-schedule them. The idea is not to make people chat about the activity, but rather just organize them, and then follow it up in other places (facebook messenger / viber / skype / etc)
- Users can select a group of people to invite, or invite just a single person
- (optional) users can select which people can't be invited to an activity
- Activities can be public (recurring, e.g. group fitness activities like running, riding a bike) or private

## Basic flow
  - User A invites user B for a beer anytime this week, and selects timeslots which he/she prefers
	  - user B accepts the offer, or re-schedules it for next week and suggest some time slots
	  - user A gets notified, and accepts it or decline it
  - User C creates a private hiking event for next Saturday, and sends the invite to bunch of friends
  - User D creates a public bike riding event, which will occur this Sunday at noon, and everyone who wants to participate can accept
