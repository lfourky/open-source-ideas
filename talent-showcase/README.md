# Talent showcase
Purpose of Talent showcase is to enable everyone to showcase their talents to the world.

## Why?
There are a lot of people who have a special talent that they'd like to share with the world, but they aren't visible enough. The goal is to enable them to upload their pictures / videos on their user page which they can then use in their CVs, or to to get more recognition.

## Main features
- Users can upload their pictures / videos to the app so that it can be browsable by everyone
- Showcases can be voted and commented on
- Showcases are browsable by category, or by how fresh / hot they are

## Basic flow
  - User A uploads a video of them playing the violin
  - User B uploads a picture of his/her recent painting
  - User C comes to browse for talents and enjoy the content
  - User D comes to search for talented musicians and hire them for a gig
  - User E comes to search for talented painters to hire them to paint a mural
