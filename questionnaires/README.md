# Questionnaires  

Purpose of questionnaires is to match like minded people, but not tie them to the platform. After a successful match, the two people are then redirected to continue their communication on social platforms of their choice.

## Why?
I always felt like I couldn't find people who think similarly and share my ideas and life purposes, and as I grew older, it became harder and harder to do so. Depending on your lifestyle, you might hardly ever have a chance of meeting someone who shares your ideals & passions - they might also be working a 9 to 5 job, and when they come home, they are too tired to come out and find some new people to hang out with - and so are you.

## Main features
- (optional) users would answer an initial, predefined set of questions which has the purpose of characterizing them (although broadly), to evaluate their initial psychological characteristics, and help the algorithm
- users have the option to create their own "yes or no" questions, and set which answer they would prefer the other person answer (so that they can be matched)
- (optional) user defined questions can have weight assigned to them, so that not every question is equally important
- (optional) users can set to their questions if the answer is a "must", meaning that if a question is considered a "must" then the user must provide the satisfactory answer to it, in order to eventually get matched. Providing the opposite answer means that the users won't get matched, even though they might think similarly in other areas
- users can browse the "questions page" and answer questions - the more questions they answer, the closer it gets them to a match 
- once two people match, they can then be both shown how to communicate with the other person (their facebook / linkedin / twitter / etc profiles) and it remains in their history
- (optional) users can choose if they want to get matched with users from all around the world, from their home country, or from their city
  
## Basic flow
  - User A answers sets that their questions (future question statements) are as follows:
	  - I love dogs [yes] / no 
	  - I am a programmer [yes] / no
	  - I can't stand cats [yes] / no
	  - I like hiking [yes] / no
	  - I like Trump yes / [no] 
	  - I'm into politics [no] / yes
	  - I like walks in the evening [yes] / no
 - User B goes to the questions page, and sees the above questions, to which (s)he provides his/her own answers
 - Assuming user B answered the questions to the user A's satisfaction, they both would get a "MATCH!" notification and links for their respective social platform profiles
