# Donation collector

Purpose of donation collector is to allow people to donate money to a good cause, little by little, cent by cent. 

## Why?
Because we all know where our tax money goes... or not. The idea is to make this process transparent, and have the whole country / city decide what matters, and not just the minority.  
If tens (or hundreds) of thousands of people donate 1 cent every day towards something, then it adds up quickly, and a goal can be reached in no time. 

## Main features
- Users can create causes
	- every cause should have a list of things it needs in order to fullfil it, stating why those things are needed and how much they're going to cost
	- after a cause is done, the receipt must be uploaded for every time money was spent so that it can be justified
- Users can pay a small amount ($10, or whatever amount they want) every month, and then choose how much of that money should be spent each day
	- they will choose which cause it goes to, and how much goes to each cause every day
	- they can select multiple causes in a single day, and the amount of money it goes towards each
- (optional) users can opt to watch ads a few times a day, so that instead of paying, they would accumulate "points" which also counts as money and can be donated 
- (optional) users can see how they compare with other users on a ranking board
- Users can browse existing causes
- A cause can/should have a set time limit, after which if it's not completed, the donated money is returned back to the users to spend on something else
	- a cause only receives money if the set goal is reached, and then they receive the full amount

## Basic flow
  - User A creates a cause for a hospital renovation, saying that it needs $50000 in order to fullfil the goal
  - User B creates a cause for a family that lost its house, saying that it needs $3000 in order to pay for next X months of rent
  - User C creates a cause for a new shared playground in the neighbourhood, saying that it needs $5000 in order to fullfil the goal
  - User D creates a cause for 10 new computers for a local highschool, saying that it needs $3000 in order to fullfil the goal
  - User E pays $5 to spend this month
	  - user E then browses the existing causes, and decides to go for the hospital renovation cause
	  - user E then selects the amount of money to donate today (e.g. 10 cents)
	  - user E selects if it should be recurring or one time only
	  - user E gets to see his/her ranking among other people on the platform
	  - user E watches an ad and collects 30 cents to use in other donations, starting next month
