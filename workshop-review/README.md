# Workshop review
Purpose of Workshop review is to review ongoing and past workshops.

## Why?
In order to promote evergrowing quality of workshops, the people who hold the workshops need to step up their game - one way to do that is for them to be reviewed anonymously after the workshop is done.

## Main features
- Users can create their workshop review page, which is separate for every workshop, but is tied to them (their user account)
- They can generate a single URL which they then send to all the workshop participants
- Users (workshop participants) can visit the provided link and anonymously review the attended workshop, providing their thoughts on what went well, what didn't go so well, etc.
- Workshop browsing for past workshops, in order to assess their quality

## Basic flow
  - Person holding the workshop creates a new workshop under his/her account, then sends it to all the attendees so that they can review it
  - Person who attended the workshop receives the URL in his/her email, and writes a comment about the workshop, stating that it was very well organized, but it wasn't in-depth enough
  - Person holding the workshop can now brag about their past workshops, by linking the URL of his/her user account on LinkedIn
