# Youtube RFC (request for comments)
Purpose of Youtube RFC is to allow commenting on videos, which have disabled comments, in order to promote free speech.

## Why?
Too many political videos have disabled their comment section, in order to hide (mostly) negative reactions to them.

## Main features
- Users can come to a page where they only need to paste a URL of a Youtube video
- After pasting the URL, they're taken to a page where commenting is enabled
- (optional) browse page showing most debated / hottest recent videos

## Basic flow
  - User notices that a certain video can't be commented on, copies the URL and pastes it into the input box
  - User is taken to a comment page where he/she can freely express his/her opinion and see other comments
