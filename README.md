# Open source ideas
The idea was to share some ideas I had (and thought were worthy of writing down) with the world, since the possibility of me ever sitting down and completing them all is quite low. 

One other thing is that, I guess, most people think that they shouldn't share their "awesome" ideas with anyone, so that they can get to work on them alone, and make a lot of money. Right? Well, it turns out ideas, if not acted upon, aren't worth much.

So, my thinking was that if anyone profits from "my" ideas, it would be great, since the greater goal for me is not to make money, but help people out. 
Therefore, if anyone uses these ideas to create something, I don't need anything in return from them - I'm glad I helped. You could let me know that you made it, and that your project became a success, but you're not obliged to do so.

Disclaimer: I do not think that these ideas are the best ideas ever and that they all will provide significant value to humanity. I just didn't want to hoard them, anymore... and prevent someone else with more energy, time and commitment to get to realize them.

If anyone else wants to drop in their ideas, feel free to do so! You'll get full recognition for it. 
If possible, do try to follow the format of other, already shared ideas as much as possible, so that this whole thing looks uniform.
